Welcome to Python Social Auth's documentation!
==============================================

Python Social Auth aims to be an easy to setup social authentication and
authorization mechanism for Python projects supporting protocols like OAuth (1
and 2), OpenId and others.

The initial codebase is derived from django-social-auth_ with the idea of
generalizing the process to suite the different frameworks around, providing
the needed tools to bring support to new frameworks.

django-social-auth_ itself was a product of modified code from from
django-twitter-oauth_ and django-openid-auth_ projects.
