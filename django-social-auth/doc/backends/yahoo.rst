Yahoo OAuth
===========
OAuth 1.0 workflow, useful if you are planning to use Yahoo's API.

- Register a new application at `Yahoo Developer Center`_, set your app domain and configure scopes (they can't be overriden by application).

- Fill ``Consumer Key`` and ``Consumer Secret`` values in the settings::

      YAHOO_CONSUMER_KEY = ''
      YAHOO_CONSUMER_SECRET = ''
